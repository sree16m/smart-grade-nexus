Now let us discuss Euclid's five postulates. They are :

**Postulate 1**: A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.

Note that this postulate tells us that at least one straight line passes through two distinct points, but it does not say that there cannot be more than one such line. However, in his work, Euclid has frequently assumed, without mentioning, that there is a unique line joining two distinct points. We state this result in the form of an axiom as follows:

**Axiom 5.1**: Given two distinct points, there is a unique line that passes through them.

How many lines passing through P also pass through Q (see Fig. 5.4)? Only one, that is, the line PQ. How many lines passing through Q also pass through P? Only one, that is, the line PQ. Thus, the statement above is self-evident, and so is taken as an axiom.

[Diagram: Figure 5.4 shows two points, P and Q, with multiple lines radiating from each point, including a line connecting P and Q.]

 the statement above is self-evident, and so is taken as an axiom.

[Diagram: Figure 5.4 shows two points, P and Q, with multiple lines radiating from each point, including a line connecting P and Q.]

**Postulate 2**: A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.

Note that what we call a line segment now-a-days is what Euclid called a terminated line. So, according to the present day terms, the second postulate says that a line segment can be extended on either side to form a line (see Fig. 5.5).

[Diagram: Figure 5.5 shows a line segment AB with arrows indicating that it can be extended indefinitely in both directions.]

**Postulate 3**: A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.

**Postulate 4**: All right angles are equal to one another.

Theorem 5.1: Two distinct lines cannot have more than one point in common.

**Proof:** Here we are given two lines $l$ and $m$. We need to prove that they have only one point in common.

For the time being, let us suppose that the two lines intersect in two distinct points, say P and Q. So, you have two lines passing through two distinct points P and Q. But this assumption clashes with the axiom that only one line can pass through two distinct points. So, the assumption that we started with, that two lines can pass through two distinct points is wrong.

From this, what can we conclude? We are forced to conclude that two distinct lines cannot have more than one point in common.

**EXERCISE 5.1**

1. Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Give reasons for your answers.

(i) Only one line can pass through a single point.

(ii) There are an infinite number of lines which pass through two distinct points.

## 5.2 Euclid's Definitions, Axioms and Postulates

[Diagram: Euclid (325 BCE - 265 BCE) Fig. 5.3, a portrait]

The Greek mathematicians of Euclid's time thought of geometry as an abstract model of the world in which they lived. The notions of point, line, plane (or surface) and so on were derived from what was seen around them. From studies of the space and solids in the space around them, an abstract geometrical notion of a solid object was developed. A solid has shape, size, position, and can be moved from one place to another. Its boundaries are called **surfaces**. They separate one part of the space from another, and are said to have no thickness. The boundaries of the surfaces are **curves** or **straight lines**. These lines end in **points**.

# 6.3 Intersecting Lines and Non-intersecting Lines

Draw two different lines PQ and RS on a paper. You will see that you can draw them in two different ways as shown in Fig. 6.5 (i) and Fig. 6.5 (ii).

[Diagram: Two diagrams are shown side-by-side. The first diagram (i) shows two lines PQ and RS intersecting. The second diagram (ii) shows two parallel lines PQ and RS.]

Fig. 6.5 : Different ways of drawing two lines

Recall the notion of a line, that it extends indefinitely in both directions. Lines PQ and RS in Fig. 6.5 (i) are intersecting lines and in Fig. 6.5 (ii) are parallel lines. Note that the lengths of the common perpendiculars at different points on these parallel lines is the same. This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines.

# 6.5 Lines Parallel to the Same Line

If two lines are parallel to the same line, will they be parallel to each other? Let us check it. See Fig. 6.18 in which line $m \parallel$ line $l$ and line $n \parallel$ line $l$.

Let us draw a line $t$ transversal for the lines, $l$, $m$ and $n$. It is given that line $m \parallel$ line $l$ and line $n \parallel$ line $l$.

Therefore, $\angle 1 = \angle 2$ and $\angle 1 = \angle 3$

(Corresponding angles axiom)

So, $\angle 2 = \angle 3$ (Why?)

But $\angle 2$ and $\angle 3$ are corresponding angles and they are equal.

Therefore, you can say that

Line $m \parallel$ Line $n$

(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)

This result can be stated in the form of the following theorem:

**Theorem 6.6:** Lines which are parallel to the same line are parallel to each other.

**Note:** The property above can be extended to more than two lines also.

Now, let us solve some examples related to parallel lines.

For example, the line PQ in Fig. 5.6 falls on lines AB and CD such that the sum of the interior angles 1 and 2 is less than 180° on the left side of PQ. Therefore, the lines AB and CD will eventually intersect on the left side of PQ.

[Diagram: Fig. 5.6 shows two lines AB and CD intersected by a line PQ. Angles 1 and 2 are marked as interior angles on the left side of PQ.]

A brief look at the five postulates brings to your notice that Postulate 5 is far more complex than any other postulate. On the other hand, Postulates 1 through 4 are so simple and obvious that these are taken as 'self-evident truths'. However, it is not possible to prove them. So, these statements are accepted without any proof (see Appendix 1). Because of its complexity, the fifth postulate will be given more attention in the next section.

Solution : In the figure given above, AC coincides with AB + BC.

Also, Euclid's Axiom (4) says that things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. So, it can be deduced that

$AB + BC = AC$

Note that in this solution, it has been assumed that there is a unique line passing through two points.

Example 2 : Prove that an equilateral triangle can be constructed on any given line segment.

## 5.3 Summary

In this chapter, you have studied the following points:

1.  Though Euclid defined a point, a line, and a plane, the definitions are not accepted by mathematicians. Therefore, these terms are now taken as undefined.

2.  Axioms or postulates are the assumptions which are obvious universal truths. They are not proved.

ossible to deduce from these axioms a statement that contradicts any axiom or previously proved statement. So, when any system of axioms is given, it needs to be ensured that the system is consistent.

After Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results. Then using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive reasoning. The statements that were proved are called **propositions** or **theorems**. Euclid deduced 465 propositions in a logical chain using his axioms, postulates, definitions and theorems proved earlier in the chain. In the next few chapters on geometry, you will be using these axioms to prove some theorems.

Now, let us see in the following examples how Euclid used his axioms and postulates for proving some of the results:

**Example 1**: If A, B and C are three points on a line, and B lies between A and C (see Fig. 5.7), then prove that $AB + BC = AC$.

it is not possible to prove them. So, these statements are accepted without any proof (see Appendix 1). Because of its complexity, the fifth postulate will be given more attention in the next section.

Now-a-days, 'postulates' and 'axioms' are terms that are used interchangeably and in the same sense. 'Postulate' is actually a verb. When we say "let us postulate", we mean, "let us make some statement based on the observed phenomenon in the Universe". Its truth/validity is checked afterwards. If it is true, then it is accepted as a 'Postulate'.

A system of axioms is called **consistent** (see Appendix 1), if it is impossible to deduce from these axioms a statement that contradicts any axiom or previously proved statement. So, when any system of axioms is given, it needs to be ensured that the system is consistent.
